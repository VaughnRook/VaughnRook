- 👋 Hi, I’m @VaughnRook named in honor of Vaughn Bishop
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Supporting my department and all coworkers at ECLPH, Early Childhood Edcucation, LMS management, Instructional Design, Useful Code, and so much more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to use GitHub, about Web Beacons, Power Automate, Quest ASLX code, and so much more
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing much yet.  Don't know any coders, and I'm not truly one yet.
- 📫 How to reach me ... best not to ATM
- 😄 Pronouns: ... they can be useful when you won't want to just name whatever it is that you're talking about
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... Platipy have venom! (is that the correct plural of Platypus?)
